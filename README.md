# textCircle
Text -editor with HTML and JS functionality
It also has private filter for the documents, comments and cooperative text editing. I used these packages:

accounts-password
iron:router
twbs:bootstrap I have already used them.
aldeed:collection2
aldeed:autoform. Forms, insert and Schema
ian:accounts-ui-bootstrap-3. More sophisticated package for accounts.
mizzao:sharejs-codemirror.
babrahams:editable-text. Editable text drop-in

In this project I`ve also removed insecure and autopublish packages.
